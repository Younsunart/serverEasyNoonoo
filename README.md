## Best practices

CSS : for each tag, use alphabetical order / One CSS file per component
JSX : one tag for one HTML object to avoid conflicts
CSS and HTML : camelCase type
All calculs will be in the back files
Redux will be used for this project

### Git

One branch per feature and per version
!! One person must work on one branch !!
Never push on master and dev
Never do two pull requests at the same time

### `npm start`

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.
